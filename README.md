# Crystal Collector

The object of the Crystal Collector game is to match the value that the computer selects. The computer generates a random value upon loading the game. The crystals are each assigned to a random number as well. When you click on a crystal it adds that respective number to your total score. If you go over the number, you lose. Good Luck!
